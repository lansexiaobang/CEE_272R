% similar to case 2, but with battery storage.
% calculate the Pstart for each generator
% develop simple case 1 bus dispatch model for each ramp
% run optimization to calculate optimal RC (NO STORAGE)
% aims to optimize the discharge/charging rate for each ramp to reduce
% total costs

% the minimum capacity for coal is 50%, for gas is 30% coal power plant's hourly ramping capacity is 60% of its generation capacity (1% per min). Gas and oil generator's hourly ramping capacity is 90%-100% of its generation capacity (3% per min).
